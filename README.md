# MechaCar-analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this statistical analysis was to determine how to get around the current production troubles that AutosRU's has had with their new prototype. The following tasks were assigned to me:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- The vehicle length and ground clearance

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- No, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero becuase of the p-value being 5.35e-11. This means that the relationship in our model is not made up of only random chance.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- I would say that it is a good first test but should not be fully relied on to be the final test as it is only ~71% accurate (indicated by the 'r' squared value). I would suggest at least one other test to get towards a better accuracy result.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
- Lot 3 does not follow the rule of staying under 100 psi. Lot 3 is ~170 which is well over the max amount.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

- Not statisitically different from pop. mean and p-value isn't enough to reject the null hypothesis.

- Lot 1 T-Test: Not statisitically different from pop. mean and p-value isn't low enough to reject the null hypothesis.

- Lot 2 T-Test: Not statisitically different from pop. mean and p-value isn't low enough to reject the null hypothesis.

- Lot 3 T-Test: Statisitically different from pop. mean and p-value is low enough to reject the null hypothesis.

# Study Design: MechaCar versus Competition

There are a lot of factors to take into consideration when comparing which car to purchase. In a world that continues to get more expensive, more of a need for internet, and reliable MPG, people are very picky when looking for their next car. With inflation, I would choose to look at cost and maintenance of the vehicle because saving money is a priority for me. I would need to obtain data that showcases the cost of the MechaCar prototypes and the maintenance costs of the MechaCar. The same goes for the competitors data and info. This info would show how MechaCars vary from initial cost and future costs compared to the market. I would use the 'r' squared values to see how future points on the linear model created would look. My null and alternative hypothesis's would be that the linear model is zero and/or not zero. This would be used to find the best cost for our MechaCar while minimizing maintenance and maximizing marketing to consumers.
