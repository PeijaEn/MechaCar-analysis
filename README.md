# MechaCar-analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this statistical analysis was to determine how to get around the current production troubles that AutosRU's has had with their new prototype. The following tasks were assigned to me:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

# Deliverables

## linear Regression to Predict MPG


# Study Design: MechaCar versus Rest of Competition
